So what are somethings we need to do/relearn here.
1) We have a clear setup for redux for our data here. Be good to get that up and running and connect it immediately to local storage.
2) There is styling obviously. Be great to get sass up and running at some point.
3) BIG priority is getting the router working. That is probably the top thing I can do. Once the router is up and running we can map out the entire flow of the site.

Having a working router is definately the first thing I need to do here. Let's get it in...

So...here is a wrinkle!

We should run things through a router first if we have multiple items one route. 

_______________________________

OK. All the links are in places for this thing. We have representative pages for every stage of the wireframe.

Now what we need is to get indivisual elements in the rest of the pages.
1) Getting the search pages for all currently created items would be cool.
2) I'm on the edge of wanting to have data served to this thing through localStorage.
3) Edit makes sense as a next step there.
4) Then adding new...
5) Finally getting Stats and the general submission search pages working.

The other issues is whether I just want to rough in the html on all the pages first and then get into making it work or do it one page at a time....

I kind of like the idea of getting edit working.
